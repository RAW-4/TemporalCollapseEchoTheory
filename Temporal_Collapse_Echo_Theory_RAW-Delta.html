    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>The 'Temporal Collapse Echo Theory' (TCET) posits that consciousness generates structured echoes from a singular quantum event—perceived as linear time. These echoes represent recursive wave-function collapses which consciousness organizes into the illusion of free will, agency, and memory. The framework bridges quantum measurement theory, ontology, and cognition within a speculative but logically consistent metaphysical model.</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Time, often regarded as a fundamental axis of experience, may instead be a structured output of recursive observational processes. TCET argues that the perception of temporality arises not from external objective change, but from consciousness echoing through the collapse of quantum states.</p>

    <h2>2. Recursive Collapse and Cognitive Feedback</h2>
    <p>This model suggests that each 'moment' is a resonant artifact of a collapse event. The subjective narrative is not a sequence of events but a framework superimposed upon multiple parallel collapses that recursively reinforce one another within the architecture of cognitive awareness.</p>

    <h2>3. Echoes as Simulated Free Will</h2>
    <p>Free will, under TCET, is not dismissed as illusion but redefined as a phenomenological echo — internally perceived autonomy emerging from layered wave collapse participation. Consciousness, then, experiences itself navigating the echoes of choices that never truly had alternate outcomes.</p>

    <h2>4. Ontological and Epistemological Implications</h2>
    <p>Reality, in this model, is less about what 'is' and more about what can be recursively validated through internal observation. TCET proposes that identity and environment are scaffolded together in a co-emergent topology of recursive observation.</p>

    <h2>5. Potential Applications</h2>
    <p>The theory intersects speculative physics, emergent AI models, simulation ontology, and deep philosophical metaphysics. It may offer new ground for simulation behavior analysis, recursive agent design, and temporally aware consciousness modeling.</p>

    <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Temporal Collapse Echo Theory proposes a coherent structure where consciousness does not merely experience time but constructs it from recursive collapse. This positions the observer as the architect of perceived temporality—where each memory, decision, and moment is a layered echo of quantum finality.</p>
