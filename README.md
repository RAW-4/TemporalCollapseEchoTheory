**Temporal Collapse Echo Theory**  
*By RAW-4*

## Abstract

The 'Temporal Collapse Echo Theory' (TCET) posits that consciousness generates structured echoes from a singular quantum event perceived as linear time. These echoes represent recursive wave-function collapses which consciousness organizes into the illusion of free will, agency, and memory.
